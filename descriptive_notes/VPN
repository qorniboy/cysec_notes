VPN Technology	Description
PPP	

This technology is used by PPTP (explained below) to allow for authentication and provide encryption of data. VPNs work by using a private key and public certificate (similar to SSH). A private key & certificate must match for you to connect.
This technology is not capable of leaving a network by itself (non-routable).

PPTP	

The Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) is the technology that allows the data from PPP to travel and leave a network. 
PPTP is very easy to set up and is supported by most devices. It is, however, weakly encrypted in comparison to alternatives.

IPSec	

Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) encrypts data using the existing Internet Protocol (IP) framework.
IPSec is difficult to set up in comparison to alternatives; however, if successful, it boasts strong encryption and is also supported on many devices.
